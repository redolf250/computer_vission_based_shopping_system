# Overview of the study
The retail industry since its inception has positioned itself as a crucial part of society. It has made shopping a regular part of consumers’ lives. A feat that has been possible through the embracement of various novel ideas that enhance the customer’s shopping experience and reduce cost. Thus, ideas that ensure efficiency, consolidation, and provision of a wide range of products and services have always been what the industry has always stood for. Aside from making a wide range of products and services available to customers, it has always invested heavily in finding solutions to problems the industry is plagued with through the usage of technology. To date, several works have focused on using state-of-the-art technology to enhance the shopping experience. Thanks to the Internet of Things, the utilization of technology in the retail industry has thus reached a point where the existing tools used are being turned into smart tools by equipping them with communication capabilities to improve their interactions with the retail environment over the Internet. The Internet of Things (IoT) which refers to the complex network of sentient objects with the ability to self-organize, share information, and resources, and act in response to events and environmental changes, has made interaction between everyday objects within the retained environment a reality now. 
With the current competitive retail world being customer-centred, retailers that ease customers of the difficulties that they face during shopping which include but are not limited to long waiting queues at the billing counter and difficulty in locating products can improve their sales, especially during the post COVID 19 and IoT era where customers now value technologies that help them identify desired items, learn about product availability, and skip payment lines.  Thus, they want the purchasing experience to be straightforward and quick and retailers must evolve to capitalize on changing customer expectations swiftly and efficiently.  Shorter waiting times and easy location of products and labels within a physical retail environment will not only save in-store shopping but will also ensure customer loyalty and improve market share. This makes automatic self-checkout systems in particular smart shopping trolleys the solution to fill this need. 
A smart shopping trolley plays a diverse role within the shopping environment as compared to the traditional one. According to Setyanto et al. (2022), a smart shopping trolley is autonomous and performs the basic function of a trolley by helping retail consumers carry items while shopping until payment for goods is done and other additional functions. Consequently, decreasing many of the hurdles to providing a seamless customer experience. It ensures shorter waiting times and reduces management costs and retail complexity. Smart shopping trolleys are being used to construct autonomous stores and to enable a self-guided shopping experience (Guimarães et al.,2023). The smart shopping trolley is a customer-focused tool and seems to support the retail industry's present technological transformation, which uses technology to rationalize and integrate service, if necessary, based on customers’ needs.
The smart shopping trolley uses advanced technologies such as microcontroller, machine learning, computer vision, RFID and barcode readers, sensors, mobile applications, internet to automate mundane tasks within the retail industry. The integration of these technologies in the traditional shopping trolley provides a lot of advantages to the industry and the customers. The mere fact that the trolley can be controlled using voice, scan purchased products automatically, generate bills, and allow customers to make payments, enhancing the in-store shopping experience is guaranteed. However, one of the major drawbacks of using most of these smart shopping trolleys is their inability to work with non-barcoded or RFID-tagged products. Thus, before using them, all products within the retail environment must be tagged with RFID tags or barcoded. Something that is not achievable practically. Even if it is achievable, it will be expensive making it difficult for a retailer to go for such a service. It is imperative to have smart shopping that can with all retail products whether barcoded, RFID tagged, or not. Computer vision-based systems are the solution to curb this difficulty. Therefore, this study aims to develop a computer vision-based shopping trolley and evaluate its usability and object detection algorithm.
